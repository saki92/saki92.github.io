        <h2>Vidiyum Munn</h2>
        <p>An exceptionally good film released in 2013. It has an well written script, a convincing plot and accompanied by a nice screenplay. The casting was perfect and performance of all lead artists was so good especially Pooja and the little girl. It makes its viewers to think that how a film can be so realistic and casual. I would say it has to be one of the benchmark for newer films. It's beginning and pace was just right to glue the viewer to their seats in just 10 minutes from the start - such an improtant necessasity for a film. Some scenes are extrordinary, particularly Pooja's dream. These small but important features of the film makes it to be as good as most of the Hollywood films - where the film makers actually 'think' and respect that the audiance too have brain. There was just 2 or 3 songs and all were at the right situation and did not reduce the pace. I'd say this is as good as Aranya Gandam.</p>
